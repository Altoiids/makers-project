This is the repository for my submission for the SDSLabs Makers 2023.

About
I have tried to create a media player that allows user to stream videos together. Basically video is stored in the device of server and the client can watch the video and even control it without physically storing video in its device. (the video will stream together on both client and server and both of them can control it, provided both of them are on same wifi). 

Features:
1. Users can watch video without spending their storage and internet data.
2. Users can control the video by pressing the following keys on keyboard
   r = rewind video by 10 secs
   f = forward video by 10 secs
   p = play/pause the video
   q = quit the video

How to start?
Clone the repository to your local system using git clone.
Run the terminal in that folder and install all necessary packages.
Type 'python3 server1.py' in terminal and run it.
Then type 'python3 client1.py' in terminal and run it.
You have to enter name of video in the 13th line of code(filename = "enter name") in server1.py file and keep the video file and code file in the same folder
